    "My Project is a data scraper and visualizer specifically for scraping US Census data documented on wikepedia pages. My code works by scanning each US Census wikepedia page from 1790 - 2010 (Note skipping 1870 because the web page HTML was poorly formatted) for the City rank table then combining all of that data into a list of CityPopulation(A class I created to store city, state, and population:year) objects. Then with all that data I have the power to create dataframs for any city in the list, and the dataframes are used to create graphs to visualize the data."

    "My python background was fairly rudimentary, but I came in as an experienced programmer in other languages like Java and Javascript. As a result, grasping the concepts wasn't too difficult, so I set higher expectations on myself for the complexity of the project. I did a lot of research into the libraries pandas, beautifulsoup4, matplotlib.pyplot, and requests to complete this project. I challenged myself by synthesizing all of these libraries and accomplishing my goal of learning how to scrape and visualize data."
